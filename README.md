# Langraph Learnings

Welcome to my Langraph learning repository!

## About
This repository documents my journey as I learn and experiment with Langraph, LangChain, and related AI workflow tools. Here you'll find Jupyter notebooks and code samples demonstrating various concepts, workflows, and integrations using these libraries.

## Contents
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Step-by-step workflows and experiments in subfolders.
- **requirements.txt:** Minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks, with comments explaining each package.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for the minimal set of Python packages needed:

```
langgraph==0.6.7        # Workflow/state graph logic
langchain-google-genai==2.1.12  # Google Generative AI model integration
langchain-core==0.3.76  # Core utilities for LangChain workflows
python-dotenv==1.1.1    # Loads environment variables from .env files
pydantic==2.11.9        # Data validation and schema definition
typing-extensions==4.15.0 # Advanced type hints (TypedDict, Literal)
IPython==9.5.0          # Notebook display features (e.g., images)
```

## My Learning Journey
I am exploring:
- How to build conditional and sequential workflows using Langraph
- Integrating Google Generative AI with LangChain
- Using Pydantic for schema validation
- Managing environment variables with python-dotenv
- Displaying results and images in Jupyter notebooks

Feel free to browse the notebooks and code to follow along with my progress!
